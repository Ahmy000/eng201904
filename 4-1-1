# 1- Visiting a Friend I
Christina is on a two week vacation.
This is the first vacation she has had for a long time.
The last vacation she took was more than two years ago.
Now she is visiting a friend in San Francisco.
Her friend and her husband are living near the center of the city.
He works for a start up company in Silicon Valley.
While he is working, she works part-time at a department store.
Christina hasn't seen her friend for a long time.
The last time they saw each other was 3 years ago.
At that time, they were both working at a department store.
Then Christina quit her job and started her own business.
She designs women's clothing.
She has 2 employees now and her company is slowly growing.
Christina has come to San Francisco by herself .
Her husband didn't come because he has to work.
He tried to start a company 2 years ago but it didn't work out.
His company failed after only a few months.
So now he's working at another company and saving money.
Once he saves enough money he plans to start another company.
He doesn't want to give up.
This is the second time Christina has been to San Francisco.
The first time was when she was a high school student.
That was more than 10 years ago.
During that trip she was only in San Francisco for a few days.
After that she went to Los Angeles and New York.
This time she and her friend plan to relax and have fun.

# 2- Visiting a Friend II
Christina arrived two days ago, the day before yesterday.
Her friend met her at the airport and drove her to her apartment.
Her apartment is just North of the airport about 20 minutes from San Francisco.
It's a small apartment, but it's on a hill and it has a great view.
Yesterday they went downtown and rode the cable cars.
Christina was surprised by how steep the hills are.
Then they walked along the ocean and ate lunch at a seafood restaurant.
From the restaurant, they could see the Golden Gate Bridge.
Tomorrow, they're planning to drive to Yosemite National Park.
By car,it's about 4 hours away.
Christina has never been there before, so she is excited.
She has heard that the park is very beautiful.
Her friend has been to Yosemite several times.
She says it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
Christina just hopes that her friend is a good driver.
