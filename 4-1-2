# 1- A Trip to Yosemite Park I
Today, Christina and her friend are enjoying themselves.
This morning they got up very early and drove out of San Francisco.
They crossed the Bay Bridge before the early morning commute and drove south.
Because it was so early, there were almost no cars.
After driving for an hour and a half, they stopped and had breakfast.
They ordered pancakes and coffee.
They also had some fresh fruit. (为什么不是fruits?)
When they finished eating, it was 7 o'clock.
Then they got back into the car and drove south.
Christina wanted to listen to music, so they turned on the radio.
An hour later they stopped for gas.
They noticed that there was also a charging station for electric cars.
It's now 1:15 and they are in Yosemite Park
They have been there for two hours, since 11:15.
They are looking at Yosemite falls, which is the highest waterfall in the Park.
The water drops a totally of 740 meters from the top of the upper fall to the base of the lower fall.

# 2- A Trip to Yosemite Park II
In another 15 minutes they planed eat lunch at a magnificent old hotel in the park.
It was built in 1927 and has a great view.
They wanted to stay there, but they couldn't get reservations.
To get a room at that hotel, you usually need to make reservations several months in advance.
They plan to stay in the park until around 4 o'clock .
By then they will have been in the park for nearly 5 hours.
Then they'll get back into the car and drive back to San Francisco.
They plan to eat dinner somewhere along the way.
If the traffic isn't too bad ,they should be back in San Francisco by 10 o'clock.
Early tomorrow morning they are going to cross the Golden Gate Bridge and go north along the coast.
From some places you can look out on ocean and sea whales and other sea life.
Christina has never seen a whale before, so she's looking forward to it.
And tomorrow night they have something special planned.
They are going to watch a baseball game.
Christina has never seen a baseball game, but she has heard that it is very popular in the US.
And the San Francisco baseball team is one of the best.
