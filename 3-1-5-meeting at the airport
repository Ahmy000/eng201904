Hey, where are you? I don't see you anywhere.
I'm on the subway.
My flight arrived early, and I'm tired.
I'm sorry to be late, I'll be there as fast as I can.
Where are you now?
There are 3 more stops, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
I'll meet you at the bus stop in front of terminal 2, then we can get a taxi.
Ok, I'll look for you in front of terminal 2, see you soon.
