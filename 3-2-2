# Paul's Trip Plan 1
In six weeks, Paul is going on a trip.
He is going to Japan and China. 
There are a couple of reasons for the trip. 
One reason is for business. 
He’s thinking about starting restaurants in both countries. 
The other reason is for pleasure. 
He enjoys traveling, and he’d like to visit some friends. 

Yesterday he went online and made airline reservations. 
There were plenty of seats on the plane, so it was easy.
He also got a good discount. 
Unfortunately, he needs a new passport. 
His old passport is expiring next week. 
This is something he didn’t expect. 
Getting a new passport will take at least a week. 
He needs to apply for one right away.

Paul also needs a visa to enter China. 
The last time he went to china was 3 years ago. 
Getting a visa may also take a week or even two. 
So he doesn’t have much time. 
He needs to hurry. 
He can’t get the visa until he gets his new passport. 
He'll have to go to the Chinese consulate Toronto. 
Hopefully there won’t be any delays.

# Paul's Trip Plan 2
Paul has several friends in each country. 
One of his best friends lives near Mount Fuji. 
His friend lives near a beautiful lake about 3 hours from Tokyo. 
His friend is a great cook and owns a little restaurant. 
The restaurant is located on a hill above the lake.
It has a wonderful view, and the food is wonderful. 
Paul is looking forward to eating there. 
Then he will spend the night at his friend’s house. 
One way to get to his friend’s house is to go by train. 
If he takes a train, his friend will meet him at the train station. 
There's a train station about half an hour from his friend’s house. 
On the other hand, he may decide to go by car. 
He can rent a car for a few days and see more of the country.
He can use a GPS to help him with directions. 
He doesn’t speak Japanese, so the directions need to be in English.

In china, Paul has a good friend who lives in Beijing. 
They studied at the same university in Canada more than 15 years ago. 
His Chinese friend wants to help Paul with his business.
He friends has lots of business experience. 
His friend can help Paul learn about doing business in china. 
Paul knows there is a lot to learn. 
He will certainly need his friend’s help. 
While in Beijing, they plan to visit several Italian restaurants. 
They may meet with some of the owners too, but it isn’t certain yet. 
Most of the owners are Chinese. 
One or two of them may want to do business with Paul.

If he has time, he may go to the Great Wall of China. 
It’s a few hours outside of Beijing by car.
Altogether, the trip may take 3 or more weeks. 
Paul still isn’t sure how long he will stay in each country. 
He may spend a week in Japan and two weeks in China. 
He may decide to stay longer. 
Everything depends on his friends. 
He expects to get more information from them in the next day or two.
