All that glitters is not gold.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
All’s well that ends well.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Blood is thicker than water.

Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

The devil is in the detail. God is in the detail.

Don’t count your chicken before the hatch.
Don’t cross the bridge until you come to it.

Even a worm will turn.

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

It ain’t over till the fat lady sings.

Many happy returns.

A picture is worth a thousand words.

The seven-year itch.

To rob Peter to pay Paul.

When lift gives your lemons, make lemonade.
