All that glitters is not gold.
All’s well that ends well.
The devil is in the detail. God is in the detail.
Don’t count your chicken before the hatch.
Even a worm will turn.
When life gives your lemons, make lemonade.
To rob Peter to pay Paul.
A picture is worth a thousand words.


All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Blood is thicker than water.

Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

Don’t cross the bridge until you come to it.

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

It ain’t over till the fat lady sings.

Many happy returns.

The seven-year itch.
