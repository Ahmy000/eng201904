M: Hey, I’m sorry to be late.
F: what happened,you will supposed to be here an hour ago.
M: Yes I know, but I missed my flight. 
F: You missed your flight？How it that happen？
M: I got on the wrong bus this morning, so I was late to the airport.
By the time I arrived, the gate was closed.
F: What did you do then？
M: I had to rebooked my flight and getting on the waiting list.
F: Oh that’s too bad. At least you got here.
M: Yes, it wasn’t easy to getting on the next flight. I had to run to another gate.
F: This kind of thing happens a lot lately. Last week I missed a flight too.
M: What happened？
F: There was a traffic accident near the airport. 
M: You were driving？
F: No, I wasn’t. I was in a taxi, but it took a long time to get to the airport. 
The traffic was stopped for nearly 15 minutes. 
By the time I got there it was too late to get on the flight. 
The next fight wasn’t for another 3 hours, so It was a long wait.
From now on, I will try to get to the airport much earlier. 
M: Me too.
