She’s taking time off so that she can visit her parents.
Her parents live in the mountains, about three hours away by train.

Christina isn’t going on the trip by herself.
Her boyfriend is going with her.
She is going to introduce him to her parents.
She and her boyfriend want to get married.
If everything goes well, they plan to get married in 6 months.
After they get married, Christina plans to quit her job. 
She wants to spend more time designing clothes.
She wants to set up her own business.
This will take time.
Her boyfriend thinks it’s a good idea.
He's also thinking about starting his own business.
They don’t plan to have children right away.
In fact, they may decide not to have children.
They don’t know yet.
It’s going to be a big decision.

She wants her parents to accept her way of life. 
Life isn’t the same now as it used to be.
