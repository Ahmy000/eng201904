# 4-Type of goverments
A state of anarchy exists when a country has no effective government.
In an anarchy, there is nobody to make decisions or enforce the laws.

An autocracy is the simplest form of government.
In an autocracy, the government is controlled by a single individual, known as the autocrat.
Whether or not an autocracy is successful depends on the character and ability of the leader.

In an oligarchy, a small group of people controls the government.
Membership in this group often depends on family connections, wealth, or military power.

In a republic, individuals are elected to represent the citizens.
The power of the government in a republic is limited by a constitution.
A constitution is a written document that makes the rules for a government to follow.
This limits the power of the government.
A constitution defines the relationship between the government and its citizens.

Without a good government，decisions that need to be made，won't be made.

What happened?
I wasn't feeling good one day, and he yelled at me. When I told him not to yell at me, he threaten me.
Is that all? That's what bosses do.
Sure, sometimes maybe. But my boss treated everyone badly, and I was tired of it. It was the last straw.
The last straw?
Yes, you know, it reached the point where I couldn't take it anymore.
I see. So now you don't have a job?
Right, I don't have a job. But at least I don't have to deal with my boss anymore.
What are you going to do now?
To be honest, I'm not sure, but I'll find something. I'll get a job, even if it pays less than before.
Are you sorry you quit?
Yes, and no.I guess I should have found another job first, and then quit.
Why didn't you?
As I said, he pushed me too far.There are some things I just won't take.
What about your wife?
She isn't happy that I don't have a job, but she understands. She knows I have a temper.And she knows I wasn't happy working there.
Well, I guess I'm lucky. My job isn't great, but I like the people I'm working with, and I like my manager.
Are you planning to stay there?
I don't know. For now it's OK, but of course it all depends on how things change.
Well if you hear of any job openings, let me know, OK?
Sure, send me your resume, and I'll let people know you're looking.
