Here is the bus schedule at a bus stop.
On most days, the buses come on schedule, but sometimes they don't.
Yesterday for example, several buses were late.
This is because the traffic yesterday was much heavier than usual.

Bus No.38 were supposed to come at 8:40, but it was 5 minutes late.
It didn't come until 8:45.
Bus No.60 was supposed to come at 8:30 but yesterday, it didn't come until 8:40.
It was 10 minutes late.
Not one bus came early.
As a result of the delays, one man got on the wrong bus.
He wanted to go to the airport, so he wanted to get on bus No.38.
He expected they'll to come at 8:40.
Instead, he got on bus No.60 which came at 8:40.
He didn't notice that it was the wrong bus.
It didn't go to the airport.
As a result, he missed his flight.
